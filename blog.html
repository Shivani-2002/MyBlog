    <p class="saying">"It's ok to be you"</p>
    <p class = "para1">It's okay sometimes 
        to show your weakness.
        It's okay to be you.
        Don't lie to yourself any more.
        Everything connects by sound.

        Hi!!! I'm gonna tell you about how I found BTS, how I loved them and their songs, how i got inspired by them, and more and more...  <br>So I came to know about BTS in the year 2019. I saw one of their songs "DNA" on youtube. I wasn't that interested at that time but since they were so popular and i saw stories and posts related to them, so I clicked on it...... <br><br> 
        I was really surprised and I instantly regretted missing it for so many days and asked myself "Why didnt I check it out just once??". I liked that song immediately in a few seconds, the music ,the dance,the background and everything. And I liked those boys as well ( ͡❛ ᴗ ͡❛)!!! I watched that song multiple times and fell in love with it. You've definitely gotta listen to that song . So I'm gonna give you the link to the song, below .

        <br><br>
     Then, I started searching about the members of this music group and I was a little bit shocked as all of them looked the same to me except for Jin(I'll tell you who that is ...).Tbh it was kind of difficult for me differentiate them and it took some time for me to recognize them. I started listening to their songs for most of the time everyday and I loved all of the songs that I've heard and also couldn't resist looking at them( ͡❛ ᴗ ͡❛).
     I liked them so much, all the 7, and watched a lot of their videos.
     Whenever you're sad, I'd definitely recommend you to watch any one of their videos. They'll be so hilarious and will definitely make you feel better. I used to laugh so hard seeing them forgetting all the other things that bothers me, at that time.
     They always care about their fans(Also called ARMY) and they help us get better through their songs and love ourselves...
     <br><br>
     So as i liked them so much, you'll definitely like them too!!! 
     <br><br> <br>
        I've used the word "them" like so many times that you might be wondering that "Who's themm(ㆆ_ㆆ)????"
        <br><br> 
        Let me show you...
    </p>
